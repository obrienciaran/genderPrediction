# genderPrediction
Gender prediction of patients from MR images from normal, healthy, subjects. 
This script was written as part of my PhD studies in the D-Lab in Maastricht University, The Netherlands. 

Using a convolutional neural network, it was investigated whether it was possible to determine the gender of a patient from T2 weighted, MR images. 

Images were downloaded in NIFTI format from the IXI dataset, which is available here:

https://brain-development.org/ixi-dataset/ 

The IXI dataset contains images from 600, healthy subjects.

The data has been collected at three different hospitals in London:

Hammersmith Hospital using a Philips 3T system (details of scanner parameters)
Guy’s Hospital using a Philips 1.5T system (details of scanner parameters)
Institute of Psychiatry using a GE 1.5T system (details of the scan parameters not available at the moment)

The data has been collected as part of the project:
IXI – Information eXtraction from Images (EPSRC GR/S21533/02)
